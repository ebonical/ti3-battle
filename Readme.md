How it works
============

Create a game
-------------

Select 'New Game' and add everybody's names who are playing. Just leave the empty 
slots blank. You can predetermine all the colours and races if you want or 
leave them on random.

This will create a code that you can give to your friends if they want to also 
manage their battles and stuff. 

Battle Board
------------

The steps are mostly obvious once inside the Battle Board. Increase unit numbers, 
modify any battle values if they haven't been applied yet and hit 'Roll Dice'. 
You can ignore the automatically generated values if you want and manually roll 
dice but you still have to press this button.

Battle Values are in the little target symbol and the number of dice to be rolled 
for a particular unit are represented as pips above the target. You should see 
that the War Sun has 3 pips. This only shows if it has more than 1 die.

### Resolving ###

If any hits have been been made you can now apply the damage to each unit. It 
isn't strict about how much damage you apply (although you can't add more than 
the number of units) so if you decided to roll your own dice or something is 
incorrect you can add more or less than is indicated.

Press 'Resolve Round' and a summary will appear for the end of the round. 
It will tell you how many units where lost and what all the dice rolls were.

If there are any units left then you can 'Continue...'

If the Attacker wins and it's a Space Battle then a button to immediately start 
Invasion Combat will be shown.

Damage applied to units like the War Sun or Dreadnought that can sustain damage 
will be carried over in to the next round.


Pre-Combat Rounds
-----------------

The Battle Board should automatically switch in to a Pre-Combat Round when 
Destroyers and Fighters are present on opposite sides during Space Combat and 
when War Suns, Dreadnoughts or PDS are present during Invasion Combat.

This test only happens during Round 1 in the setup phase and if you click 
'Skip to Round 1' it will skip pre-combat for this battle.

The app doesn't handle any other types of pre-combat actions so you will have to 
manage these manually for now.


Things still to do... 
---------------------

* Toggle optional combat modifiers from racial abilities and game mechanics -
  like High Alert battle bonus and Letnev combat bonuses
* Leaders in combat
* Responsive styling to better fit web view in mobile browsers
* Switch to manage another player during game
* Refresh other player's technology lists
* Apply pre-existing sustained damage to units like War Sun and Dreadnought
* Abilities that allow dice re-rolls for misses
* Write some tests!
* and lots of other things...
